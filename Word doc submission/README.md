Hi Jo,

Hope you’re well. Please see links below…

Fingers crossed they work ok…but if not/if I’ve missed something, just let me know and I’ll send them through again.

I tried my best to get the circles arranged around the image evenly, but I struggled a bit this afternoon. Any pointers would be much appreciated!

Thanks for everything!

Angela :-)
